Models\n","-----------------------\n","\n","Although we have put a great deal of effort into preparing and massaging our\n","data into a nice vocabulary object and list of sentence pairs, our models\n","will ultimately expect numerical torch tensors as inputs. One way to\n","prepare the processed data for the models can be found in the `seq2seq\n","translation\n","tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html>`__.\n","In that tutorial, we use a batch size of 1, meaning that all we have to\n","do is convert the words in our sentence pairs to their corresponding\n","indexes from the vocabulary and feed this to the models.\n","\n","However, if you’re interested in speeding up training and/or would like\n","to leverage GPU parallelization capabilities, you will need to train\n","with mini-batches.\n","\n","Using mini-batches also means that we must be mindful of the variation\n","of sentence length in our batches. To accomodate sentences of different\n","sizes in the same batch, we will make our batched input tensor of shape\n","*(max_length, batch_size)*, where sentences shorter than the\n","*max_length* are zero padded after an *EOS_token*.\n","\n","If we simply convert our English sentences to tensors by converting\n","words to their indexes(\\ ``indexesFromSentence``) and zero-pad, our\n","tensor would have shape *(batch_size, max_length)* and indexing the\n","first dimension would return a full sequence across all time-steps.\n","However, we need to be able to index our batch along time, and across\n","all sequences in the batch. Therefore, we transpose our input batch\n","shape to *(max_length, batch_size)*, so that indexing across the first\n","dimension returns a time step across all sentences in the batch. We\n","handle this transpose implicitly in the ``zeroPadding`` function.\n","\n",".. figure:: /_static/img/chatbot/seq2seq_batches.png\n","   :align: center\n","   :alt: batches\n","\n","The ``inputVar`` function handles the process of converting sentences to\n","tensor, ultimately creating a correctly shaped zero-padded tensor. It\n","also returns a tensor of ``lengths`` for each of the sequences in the\n","batch which will be passed to our decoder later.\n","\n","The ``outputVar`` function performs a similar function to ``inputVar``,\n","but instead of returning a ``lengths`` tensor, it returns a binary mask\n","tensor and a maximum target sentence length. The binary mask tensor has\n","the same shape as the output target tensor, but every element that is a\n","*PAD_token* is 0 and all others are 1.\n","\n","``batch2TrainData`` simply takes a bunch of
